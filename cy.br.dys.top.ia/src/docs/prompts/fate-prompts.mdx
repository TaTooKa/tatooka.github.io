# FATE PROMPTS

## PAY THE CONSEQUENCES
⋗ **When you suffer the outcome of a mechanical or narrative <span class="fuchsia">FAILURE</span>**, choose one (If a prompt specified X as `minor|serious|major` or you obtained a <span class="fuchsia bold">CRITICAL FAILURE</span>, make it worse or choose more than one):

- Trigger a prompt that makes sense for your actions: [ENDURE HARM (X)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-harm), [ENDURE STRESS (X)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#endure-stress) or [SACRIFICE RESOURCES (X)](/prompts/suffer-prompts#sacrifice-resources).
- Make the most obvious negative narrative outcome happen.
- [QUERY THE FATES](/prompts/fate-prompts#query-the-fates) for inspiration. Interpret the answer as a hardship or complication appropriate to the situation.

## QUERY THE FATES
⋗ **When you seek to resolve questions, discover details, reveal locations, determine how other characters respond, or trigger encounters or events,** you may...

- <span class="turquoise bold">Draw a conclusion</span>: Decide the answer based on the most interesting and obvious result.
- <span class="turquoise bold">Spark an idea</span>: Use an Oracle table or another random prompt.
- <span class="turquoise bold">Ask a yes/no question</span>: Decide the odds of a yes, and roll on the table below to check the answer.
- <span class="turquoise bold">Pick two</span>: Envision two options. Rate one as ‘likely’, and roll on the table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.

| Odds | The answer is yes if you roll... |
| ---: | :--- |
| Almost Certain | 90 or less |
| Likely | 75 or less | 
| 50/50 | 50 or less |
| Unlikely | 25 or less |
| Small Chance | 10 or less |

## IMPROVE YOURSELF
⋗ **When you have some spare time and XP and want to improve yourself or your assets**, envision how you gain your new benefits and spend your XP as follows:
- <span class="turquoise bold">Improve your STATS</span>: Add 1 per XP spent.<br/>
    Can’t increase greater than 99.
- <span class="turquoise bold">Gain a new TRAIT</span>: Each costs 20 XP.

## RETIRE
⋗ **When you consider it’s a good time to retire**, test against your ANGLE challenge progress value.
<AffectingTraits promptName="Retire"/>

<hr class="gradient-hr-turquoise"/>

&nbsp;<span class="turquoise bold">⋙ SUCCESS</span>: You successfully fulfill your ANGLE.

Envision and describe this final fate however you see fit, then <span class="turquoise bold">retire your character</span> (they turn into an NPC, leave to a better place, die honorably, etc).

> If you create a new character that was close to this one, or somehow inherited their gear or wisdom, they start with 50 XP.<br/><br/>
> If <span class="turquoise bold">CRITICAL</span>, they start with 100 XP instead.

<hr class="gradient-hr-fuchsia"/>

&nbsp;<span class="fuchsia bold">⋙ FAILURE</span>: You utterly fail at achieving your ANGLE.

Envision how this develops negatively or your objective falls just out of reach. Then <span class="fuchsia bold">retire your character</span> (they turn into an NPC, leave to a better place, die honorably, etc).

> If you create a new character that was close to this one, or somehow inherited their gear or wisdom, they start with 25 XP.
